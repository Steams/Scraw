* Day 1 - Sunday Dec 18,2016
** Determined the different functionality the lib should expose 
based on the praw docs and what functionality existing bots use
** Determiend the different functional systems in the lib
* Day 2 - Monday Dec 19,2016
** Decided to design the library (or a subset of it) to a decent extent first before coding
* Day 3 - Tuesday Dec 20,2016
** dug into the source code for JRAW to see how it handles authentication
in order to figure out a way around the problem i was having with scalaj-http authenticating with oauth
** tracked down http://snacktrace.com/artifacts/com.squareup.okhttp3/okhttp/3.1.2/okhttp3.Credentials
that credentials functions which shed a ton of light on what gets passed in the header for an oath request.
Turns out its just a base64 encoded version of the clientid and secret concatenated
