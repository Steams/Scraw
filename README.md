# Scraw
Scala Reddit API Wrapper library (Work in progress). Inspired by PRAW and JRAW.

The aim of this project is to provide a wrapper for Reddit's API which exposes an easy to use interface in idiomatic, functional scala. 

This library is intended as a convinience to those wishing to build reddit bots, scrapers or applications using the Scala language and tooling.
